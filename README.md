# Comprehensive search for accessory proteins encoded with archaeal and bacterial Type III CRISPR-Cas gene cassettes reveals 39 new cas gene families

A study was undertaken to identify conserved proteins that are encoded adjacent to cas gene
cassettes of Type III CRISPR-Cas (Clusters of Regularly IntersSpaced Palindromic Repeats -
CRISPR associated) interference modules. Type III modules have been shown to target and degrade
dsDNA, ssDNA and ssRNA and are frequently intertwined with cofunctional accessory genes,
including genes encoding CRISPR-associated Rossman Fold (CARF) domains. 
Using a comparative genomics approach, and defining a Type III association score accounting for
coevolution and specificity of flanking genes, we identified and classified 39 new Type III
associated gene families. Most archaeal and bacterial Type III modules were seen to be flanked by
several accessory genes, around half of which did not encode CARF domains and remain of
unknown function. Northern blotting and interference assays in Synechocystis confirmed that one
particular non-CARF accessory protein family was involved in crRNA maturation. Non-CARF
accessory genes were generally diverse, encoding nuclease, helicase, protease, ATPase, transporter
and transmembrane domains with some encoding no known domains. 
We infer that additional families of non-CARF accessory proteins remain to be found. 
The method employed is scalable for potential application on metagenomic data once 
automated pipelines for annotation of CRISPR-Cas systems have been developed. 
All accessory genes found in this study are presented online in a
readily accessible and searchable format for researchers to audit their model organism of choice:
