A study was undertaken to identify conserved proteins that are encoded either within, or directly
adjacent to, cas gene cassettes of Type III CRISPR-Cas interference modules. These Type III
modules are especially versatile functionally and have been shown to target and degrade dsDNA,
ssDNA and ssRNA. In addition, the interference gene cassettes are frequently intertwined with
other accessory genes, including genes encoding CARF domains, some of which are likely to be
cofunctional. Using a comparative genomics approach, and defining a Type III association score
accounting for coevolution and specificity of flanking genes, we identified and classified 39 new
Type III associated gene families. Most archaeal and bacterial Type III modules were seen to be
flanked by several accessory genes, around half of which did not encode CARF domains and
remain of unknown function. Non-CARF accessory genes were found to be more diverse than their
CARF counterparts, encoding nuclease, helicase, protease, ATPase, transporter and transmembrane
domains and including a considerable fraction that encoded no known domains. The diversity of
non-CARF Type III accessory genes found in this study suggests that additional families exist
which remain undetected because of the limited number of annotated genomes currently available.
The method employed is scalable for potential application on metagenomic data once automated
pipelines for annotation of CRISPR-Cas systems have been developed. All accessory genes found in
this study are presented online in a readily accessible and searchable format for researchers to audit
their model organism of choice: http://accessory.crispr.dk.
