#Table S2

Gene names, and host genome accession numbers are given for each putative accessory gene 
together with its gene cluster id and the adjacent Type III module subtype. Gene maps can be 
viewed for each gene by clicking on its name. The maps illustrate the genomic context of each 
gene including the neighbouring Type III module (red) and other accessory genes (purple) 
or core cas genes from other systems (blue, adaptation and yellow, interference, and orange, processing) 
flanking the same module. Clicking the gene maps links to the gene entry in the RefSeq database for retrieval
of protein or gene sequences and the option of initiating a BLAST or CDD search with an additional click.
