# Table S1

List of putative accessory gene clusters conserved near Type III genetic  modules which passed the Type
III association score cut-off (>24). A few gene families with lower scores are also included because they 
have been confirmed as accessory proteins in earlier studies.  For each putative accessory protein family, 
the cluster id, the size (i.e. number of members per cluster), and the calculated  Type III association 
score are listed. An example (gene-) locus id is also provided for reference. Names are provided for accessory protein 
families identified in earlier studies (Haft et al. 2005;  Vestergaard et al. 2014; Makarova et al. 2014). 
Thirty nine of 76 putative accessory protein families are newly identified.  Links to sequence alignments, 
gene and genome maps are provided as well as profile-profile alignment results against Pfam and PDB. 
A predicted function is given in the last two columns.
