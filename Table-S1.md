# Table S1

List of putative accessory gene clusters conserved near Type III genetic modules which passed the Type III association score cut-off (>24). All annotated accessory protein sequences are available in Shah2018.TypeIIIaccessory.faa. For each putative accessory protein family, the cluster id, the size (i.e. number of members per cluster), and the calculated Type III association score are listed. An example (gene-) locus id is also provided for reference. Names are provided for accessory protein families identified in earlier studies (Haft et al. 2005; Vestergaard et al. 2014; Makarova et al. 2015). Thirty nine of 76 putative accessory protein families are newly identified. Links to sequence alignments, gene and genome maps are provided as well as profile-profile alignment results against Pfam and PDB. A rudimentary functional prediction is given in the last two columns.
