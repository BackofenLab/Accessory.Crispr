Members of this family, which are found in the prokaryotic protein glycosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase, assume a gamma-crystallin-type fold with a five-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet that packs against the C-terminal side of a beta-alpha barrel. This domain is common to family 13 glycosidases and typically contains a five to ten strand beta-sheet, however its precise fold varies.</td></tr>

RasA2 and RasA3 are GAP1s (GTPase activating protein 1s ), Ras-specific GAP members, which suppresses Ras function by enhancing the GTPase activity of Ras proteins resulting in the inactive GDP-bound form of Ras. In this way it can control cellular proliferation and differentiation.  RasA2 and RasA3 are both inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate-binding proteins and contain an N-terminal C2 domain, a Ras-GAP domain, a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain which localizes it to the plasma membrane, and Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) a zinc binding domain. C2 domains fold into an 8-standed beta-sandwich that can adopt 2 structural arrangements: Type I and Type II, distinguished by a circular permutation involving their N- and C-terminal beta strands. Many C2 domains are Ca2+-dependent membrane-targeting modules that bind a wide variety of substances including bind phospholipids, inositol polyphosphates, and intracellular proteins.  Most C2 domain proteins are either signal transduction enzymes that contain a single C2 domain, such as protein kinase C, or membrane trafficking proteins which contain at least two C2 domains, such as synaptotagmin 1.  However, there are a few exceptions to this including RIM isoforms and some splice variants of piccolo/aczonin and intersectin which only have a single C2 domain.  C2 domains with a calcium binding region have negatively charged residues, primarily aspartates, that serve as ligands for calcium ions. This cd contains the first C2 repeat, C2A, and has a type-I topology.</td></tr>

SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain of EPH-A5 subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases is a C-terminal potential protein-protein interaction domain. This domain is located in the cytoplasmic region of EPH-A5 receptors and appears to mediate cell-cell initiated signal transduction. Eph-A5 gene is almost exclusively expressed in the nervous system. Murine EPH-A5 receptors participate in axon guidance during embryogenesis and play a role in the adult synaptic plasticity, particularly in neuron-target interactions in multiple neural circuits. Additionally EPH-A5 receptors and its ligand ephrin A5 regulate dopaminergic axon outgrowth and influence the formation of the midbrain dopaminergic pathways. EphA5 gene expression was found decreased in a few different breast cancer cell lines, thus it might be a potential molecular marker for breast cancer carcinogenesis and progression.</td></tr>

SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain of EPH (erythropoietin-producing hepatocyte) family of receptor tyrosine kinases is a C-terminal signal transduction module located in the cytoplasmic region of these receptors. SAM appears to mediate cell-cell initiated signal transduction via binding proteins to a conserved tyrosine that is phosphorylated. In some cases the SAM domain mediates homodimerization/oligomerization and plays a role in the clustering process necessary for signaling. EPH kinases are the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases. They are classified into two groups based on their abilities to bind ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands. The EPH receptors are involved in regulation of cell movement, shape, and attachment during embryonic development; they control cell-cell interactions in the vascular, nervous, epithelial, and immune systems, and in many tumors. They are potential molecular markers for cancer diagnostics and potential targets for cancer therapy.</td></tr>

This presumed domain has been predicted to contain three alpha helices. The domain was named the WIYLD domain based on the pattern of most conserved residues. It binds ubiquitin. In the Arabidopsis thaliana histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SUVR4, binding of ubiquitin to this domain stimulates enzymatic activity and converts its activity from a strict dimethylase to a di/trimethylase.</td></tr>

Proto-oncogene vav is a member of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) for the Rho family of GTP binding proteins. All vavs are activated by tyrosine phosphorylation leading to their activation. There are three Vav mammalian family members: Vav1 which is expressed in the hematopoietic system, and Vav2 and Vav3 are more ubiquitously expressed. Vav2 is a GEF for RhoA, RhoB and RhoG and may activate Rac1 and Cdc42. Vav2 has been shown to interact with CD19 and Grb2. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for Vav2. Vav proteins are involved in several processes that require cytoskeletal reorganization, such as the formation of the immunological synapse (IS), phagocytosis, platelet aggregation, spreading, and transformation. Vavs function as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for the Rho/Rac family of GTPases. Vav family members have several conserved motifs/domains including: a leucine-rich region, a leucine-zipper, a calponin homology (CH) domain, an acidic domain, a Dbl-homology (DH) domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a cysteine-rich domain, 2 SH3 domains, a proline-rich region, and a SH2 domain.  Vavs are the only known Rho GEFs that have both the DH/PH motifs and SH2/SH3 domains in the same protein. The leucine-rich helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain is thought to be involved in protein heterodimerization with other HLH proteins and it may function as a negative regulator by forming inactive heterodimers. The CH domain  is usually involved in the association with filamentous actin, but in Vav it controls NFAT stimulation, Ca2+ mobilization, and its transforming activity. Acidic domains are involved in protein-protein interactions and contain regulatory tyrosines. The DH domain is a GDP-GTP exchange factor on Rho/Rac GTPases. The PH domain in involved in interactions with GTP-binding proteins, lipids and/or phosphorylated serine/threonine residues. The SH3 domain is involved in localization of proteins to specific sites within the cell interacting with protein with proline-rich sequences. The SH2 domain mediates a high affinity interaction with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. In general SH2 domains are involved in signal transduction. They typically bind pTyr-containing ligands via two surface pockets, a pTyr and hydrophobic binding pocket, allowing proteins with SH2 domains to localize to tyrosine phosphorylated sites.</td></tr>
