The principal role of the p97-p47 complex is to regulate membrane fusion events. Mono-ubiquitin recognition by p47 is crucial for p97-p47-mediated Golgi membrane fusion events.  p47 has carboxy-terminal SEP and UBX domains.  The UBX domain has a beta-grasp fold similar to that of ubiquitin however, UBX lacks the c-terminal double glycine motif and is thus unlikely to be conjugated to other proteins.</td></tr>

Sbf1 is a myotubularin-related pseudo-phosphatase. Both Sbf1 and myotubularin interact with the SET domains of Hrx and other epigenetic regulatory proteins, but Sbf1 lacks phosphatase activity due to several amino acid changes in its structurally preserved catalytic pocket. It contains pleckstrin (PH), GEF, and myotubularin homology domains that are thought to be responsible for signaling and growth control. Sbf1 functions as an inhibitor of cellular growth. The N-terminal GEF homology domain serves to inhibit the transforming effects of Sbf1. PH domains have diverse functions, but in general are involved in targeting proteins to the appropriate cellular location or in the interaction with a binding partner. They share little sequence conservation, but all have a common fold, which is electrostatically polarized. Less than 10% of PH domains bind phosphoinositide phosphates (PIPs) with high affinity and specificity. PH domains are distinguished from other PIP-binding domains by their specific high-affinity binding to PIPs with two vicinal phosphate groups: PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 which results in targeting some PH domain proteins to the plasma membrane. A few display strong specificity in lipid binding. Any specificity is usually determined by loop regions or insertions in the N-terminus of the domain, which are not conserved across all PH domains. PH domains are found in cellular signaling proteins such as serine/threonine kinase, tyrosine kinases, regulators of G-proteins, endocytotic GTPases, adaptors, as well as cytoskeletal associated molecules and in lipid associated enzymes.</td></tr>

Both the C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) and CSK-homologous kinase (CHK) are members of the CSK-family of protein tyrosine kinases. These proteins suppress activity of Src-family kinases (SFK) by selectively phosphorylating the conserved C-terminal tail regulatory tyrosine by a similar mechanism. CHK is also capable of inhibiting SFKs by a non-catalytic mechanism that involves binding of CHK to SFKs to form stable protein complexes. The unphosphorylated form of SFKs is inhibited by CSK and CHK by a two-step mechanism. The first step involves the formation of a complex of SFKs with CSK/CHK with the SFKs in the complex are inactive. The second step, involves the phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail tyrosine of SFKs, which then dissociates and adopt an inactive conformation. The structural basis of how the phosphorylated SFKs dissociate from CSK/CHK to adopt the inactive conformation is not known. The inactive conformation of SFKs is stabilized by two intramolecular inhibitory interactions: (a) the pYT:SH2 interaction in which the phosphorylated C-terminal tail tyrosine (YT) binds to the SH2 domain, and (b) the linker:SH3 interaction of which the SH2-kinase domain linker binds to the SH3 domain. SFKs are activated by multiple mechanisms including binding of the ligands to the SH2 and SH3 domains to displace the two inhibitory intramolecular interactions, autophosphorylation, and dephosphorylation of YT. By selective phosphorylation and the non-catalytic inhibitory mechanism CSK and CHK are able to inhibit the active forms of SFKs. CSK and CHK are regulated by phosphorylation and inter-domain interactions. They both contain SH3, SH2, and kinase domains separated by the SH3-SH2 connector and SH2 kinase linker, intervening segments separating the three domains. They lack a conserved tyrosine phosphorylation site in the kinase domain and the C-terminal tail regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation site. The CSK SH2 domain is crucial for stabilizing the kinase domain in the active conformation. A disulfide bond here regulates CSK kinase activity. The subcellular localization and activity of CSK are regulated by its SH2 domain. In general SH2 domains are involved in signal transduction.  They typically bind pTyr-containing ligands via two surface pockets, a pTyr and hydrophobic binding pocket, allowing proteins with SH2 domains to localize to tyrosine phosphorylated sites.</td></tr>

Post-translational ubiquitin-protein conjugates are recognized for degradation by the ubiquitin fusion degradation (UFD) pathway. Several proteins involved in this pathway have been identified. This family includes UFD1, a 40kD protein that is essential for vegetative cell viability. The human UFD1 gene is expressed at high levels during embryogenesis, especially in the eyes and in the inner ear primordia and is thought to be important in the determination of ectoderm-derived structures, including neural crest cells. In addition, this gene is deleted in the CATCH-22 (cardiac defects, abnormal facies, thymic hypoplasia, cleft palate and hypocalcaemia with deletions on chromosome 22) syndrome. This clinical syndrome is associated with a variety of developmental defects, all characterized by microdeletions on 22q11.2. Two such developmental defects are the DiGeorge syndrome OMIM:188400, and the velo-cardio- facial syndrome OMIM:145410. Several of the abnormalities associated with these conditions are thought to be due to defective neural crest cell differentiation.</td></tr>
