The ligand binding domain of the TR4 and TR2 (human testicular receptor 4 and 2):  TR4 and TR2 are orphan nuclear receptors. Several isoforms of TR4 and TR2 have been isolated in various tissues. TR2 is abundantly expressed in the androgen-sensitive prostate. TR4 transcripts are expressed in many tissues, including central nervous system, adrenal gland, spleen, thyroid gland, and prostate. The expression of TR2 is negatively regulated by androgen, retinoids, and radiation. The expression of both mouse TR2 and TR4 is up-regulated by neurocytokine ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) in mouse. It has shown that human TR2 binds to a wide spectrum of natural hormone response elements (HREs) with distinct affinities suggesting that TR2 may cross-talk with other gene expression regulation systems. The genes responding to TR2 or TR4 include genes that are regulated by retinoic acid receptor, vitamin D receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor. TR4/2 binds to HREs as a dimer. Like other members of the nuclea r receptor (NR) superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, TR2-like receptors  have  a central well conserved DNA binding domain (DBD), a variable N-terminal domain, a flexible hinge and a C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD).</td></tr>

Nuclear receptors form a superfamily of ligand-activated transcription regulators, which regulate various physiological functions, from development, reproduction, to homeostasis and metabolism in animals (metazoans). The family contains not only receptors for known ligands but also orphan receptors for which ligands do not exist or have not been identified.

We have named this region the SPX domain after (SYG1, Pho81 and XPR1). This 180 residue length domain is found at the amino terminus of a variety of proteins. In the yeast protein SYG1, the N-terminus directly binds to the G- protein beta subunit and inhibits transduction of the mating pheromone signal. This finding suggests that all the members of this family are involved in G-protein associated signal transduction. The N-termini of several proteins involved in the regulation of phosphate transport, including the putative phosphate level sensors PHO81 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and NUC-2 from Neurospora crassa, are also members of this family. The SPX domain of S. cerevisiae low-affinity phosphate transporters Pho87 and Pho90 auto-regulates uptake and prevents efflux. This SPX dependent inhibition is mediated by the physical interaction with Spl2 NUC-2 contains several ankyrin repeats pfam00023. Several members of this family are annotated as XPR1 proteins: the xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor confers susceptibility to infection with murine leukaemia viruses (MLV). The similarity between SYG1, phosphate regulators and XPR1 sequences has been previously noted, as has the additional similarity to several predicted proteins, of unknown function, from Drosophila melanogaster, Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, given the similarities between XPR1 and SYG1 and phosphate regulatory proteins, it has been proposed that XPR1 might be involved in G-protein associated signal transduction and may itself function as a phosphate sensor.</td></tr>
