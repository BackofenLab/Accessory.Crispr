S100A10 is a member of the S100 family of EF-hand superfamily of calcium-binding proteins. Note that the S-100 hierarchy, to which this S-100A10 group belongs, contains only S-100 EF-hand domains, other EF-hands have been modeled separately. S100 proteins are expressed exclusively in vertebrates, and are implicated in intracellular and extracellular regulatory activities. A unique feature of S100A10 is that it contains mutation in both of the calcium binding sites, making it calcium insensitive. S100A10 has been detected in brain, heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, testes, epidermis, aorta, and thymus. Structural data supports the homo- and hetero-dimeric as well as hetero-tetrameric nature of the protein. S100A10 has multiple binding partners in its calcium free state and is therefore involved in many diverse biological functions.</td></tr>

SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain repeat 1 of liprin-beta1,2 proteins is a protein-protein interaction domain. Liprin-beta protein contain three copies (repeats) of SAM domain. They may form heterodimers with liprins-alpha through their SAM domains. It was suggested based on bioinformatic approaches that the second SAM domain of liprin-beta is potentially able to form polymers. Liprins were originally identified as LAR (leukocyte common antigen-related) transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase-interacting proteins. They participate in mammary gland development, in axon guidance, and in the maintenance of lymphatic vessel integrity.</td></tr>

SinR is a pleiotropic regulator of several late growth processes. It is a tetrameric DNA binding protein whose activity is down-regulated thorough the formation of a SinI:SinR protein complex. When complexed with SinI, the SinR tetramer is disrupted such that is no longer able to bind DNA.</td></tr>

Members of this family are closely homologous to the flagellar biosynthesis protein FlhA (TIGR01398) and should all participate in type III secretion systems. Examples include InvA (Salmonella enterica), LcrD (Yersinia enterocolitica), HrcV (Xanthomonas), etc. Type III secretion systems resemble flagellar biogenesis systems, and may share the property of translocating special classes of peptides through the membrane. </td></tr>

BAR domains are dimerization, lipid binding and curvature sensing modules found in many different proteins with diverse functions. Sorting nexins (SNXs) are Phox homology (PX) domain containing proteins that are involved in regulating membrane traffic and protein sorting in the endosomal system. SNXs differ from each other in their lipid-binding specificity, subcellular localization and specific function in the endocytic pathway. A subset of SNXs also contain BAR domains. The PX-BAR structural unit determines the specific membrane targeting of SNXs. SNX2 is a component of the retromer complex, a membrane coat multimeric complex required for endosomal retrieval of lysosomal hydrolase receptors to the Golgi. The retromer consists of a cargo-recognition subcomplex and a subcomplex formed by a dimer of sorting nexins (SNX1 and/or SNX2), which ensures effcient cargo sorting by facilitating proper membrane localization of the cargo-recognition subcomplex. BAR domains form dimers that bind to membranes, induce membrane bending and curvature, and may also be involved in protein-protein interactions.</td></tr>

Hemagglutinin from influenza virus causes membrane fusion of the viral membrane with the host membrane. Fusion occurs after the host cell internalises the virus by endocytosis. The drop of pH causes release of a hydrophobic fusion peptide and a large conformational change leading to membrane fusion.</td></tr>
