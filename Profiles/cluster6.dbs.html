This model represents a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the second and third steps (cysteine ligation, EC 6.3.2.5, and decarboxylation, EC 4.1.1.36) in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A (CoA) from pantothenate in bacteria. In early descriptions of this flavoprotein, a ts mutation in one region of the protein appeared to cause a defect in DNA metaobolism rather than an increased need for the pantothenate precursor beta-alanine. This protein was then called dfp, for DNA/pantothenate metabolism flavoprotein. The authors responsible for detecting phosphopantothenate--cysteine ligase activity suggest renaming this bifunctional protein coaBC for its role in CoA biosynthesis. This enzyme contains the FMN cofactor, but no FAD or pyruvoyl group. The amino-terminal region contains the phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase activity. </td></tr>

Anti-anti-sigma factors play an important role in the regulation of several sigma factors and their corresponding anti-sigma factors. Upon dephosphorylation they bind the anti-sigma factor and induce the release of the sigma factor from the anti-sigma factor. In a feedback mechanism the anti-anti-sigma factor can be inactivated via phosphorylation by the anti-sigma factor. Well studied examples from Bacillus subtilis are SpoIIAA (regulating sigmaF and sigmaC which play an important role in sporulation) and RsbV (regulating sigmaB involved in the general stress response). The STAS domain is also found in the C- terminal region of sulphate transporters and stressosomes.</td></tr>
