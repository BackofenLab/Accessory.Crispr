By increasing the number of non-reducing ends, glycogen is more reactive to synthesis and digestion as well as being more soluble. This group includes bacterial and eukaryotic proteins.

No archaea have this enzyme, although Aquifex aolicus does. Two species, Bacillus thuringiensis and Clostridium perfringens have two sequences each which are annotated as amylases.

A branching enzyme from Porphyromonas gingivales, OMNI|PG1793, appears to be more closely related to the eukaryotic species (across a deep phylogenetic split) and may represent an instance of lateral transfer from this species' host. A sequence from Arabidopsis thaliana, GP|9294564, scores just above trusted, but appears either to contain corrupt sequence or, more likely, to be a pseudogene as some of the conserved catalytic residues common to the alpha amylase family are not conserved here. </td></tr>

Debranching enzymes perform two activities: 4-alpha-D-glucanotransferase (EC 2.4.1.25) and amylo-1,6-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.33). 4-alpha-D-glucanotransferase catalyzes the endohydrolysis of 1,6-alpha-D-glucoside linkages at points of branching in chains of 1,4-linked alpha-D-glucose residues. Amylo-alpha-1,6-glucosidase catalyzes the endohydrolysis of 1,6-alpha-D-glucoside linkages at points of branching in chains of 1,4-linked alpha-D-glucose residues. In Escherichia coli, GlgX is the debranching enzyme and malQ is the 4-alpha-glucanotransferase. TreX, an archaeal glycogen-debranching enzyme has dual activities like mammals and yeast, but is structurally similar to GlgX. TreX exists in two oligomeric states, a dimer and tetramer.

GlgE is a (1,4)-a-D-glucan:phosphate a-D-maltosyltransferase, involved in a-glucan biosynthesis in bacteria. It is also an anti-tuberculosis drug target. GlgE isoform I from Streptomyces coelicolor has the same catalytic and very similar kinetic properties to GlgE from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. GlgE from Streptomyces coelicolor forms a homodimer with each subunit comprising five domains (A, B, C, N, and S) and 2 inserts. Domain A is a catalytic alpha-amylase-type domain that along with domain N, which has a beta-sandwich fold and forms the core of the dimer interface, binds cyclodextrins. Domain A, B, and the 2 inserts define a well conserved donor pocket that binds maltose. Cyclodextrins competitively inhibit the binding of maltooligosaccharides to the S. coelicolor enzyme, indicating that the hydrophobic patch overlaps with the acceptor binding site. This is not the case in M. tuberculosis GlgE because cyclodextrins do not inhibit this enzyme, despite acceptor length specificity being conserved. Domain C is hypothesized to help stabilize domain A and could be involved in substrate binding. Domain S is a helix bundle that is inserted within the N domain and it plays a role in the dimer interface and interacts directly with domain B. The Alpha-amylase family comprises the largest family of glycoside hydrolases (GH), with the majority of enzymes acting on starch, glycogen, and related oligo- and polysaccharides. These proteins catalyze the transformation of alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glucosidic linkages with retention of the anomeric center. The protein is described as having 3 domains: A, B, C. A is a (beta/alpha) 8-barrel; B is a loop between the beta 3 strand and alpha 3 helix of A; C is the C-terminal extension characterized by a Greek key. The majority of the enzymes have an active site cleft found between domains A and B where a triad of catalytic residues (Asp, Glu and Asp) performs catalysis. Other members of this family have lost the catalytic activity as in the case of the human 4F2hc, or only have 2 residues that serve as the catalytic nucleophile and the acid/base, such as Thermus A4 beta-galactosidase with 2 Glu residues (GH42) and human alpha-galactosidase with 2 Asp residues (GH31). The family members are quite extensive and include: alpha amylase, maltosyltransferase, cyclodextrin glycotransferase, maltogenic amylase, neopullulanase, isoamylase, 1,4-alpha-D-glucan maltotetrahydrolase, 4-alpha-glucotransferase, oligo-1,6-glucosidase, amylosucrase, sucrose phosphorylase, and amylomaltase.</td></tr>

Debranching enzymes facilitate the breakdown of glycogen through glucosyltransferase and glucosidase activity. These activities are performed by a single enzyme in mammals, yeast, and some bacteria, but by two distinct enzymes in Escherichia coli and other bacteria. Debranching enzymes perform two activities, 4-alpha-D-glucanotransferase (EC 2.4.1.25) and amylo-1,6-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.33). 4-alpha-D-glucanotransferase catalyzes the endohydrolysis of 1,6-alpha-D-glucoside linkages at points of branching in chains of 1,4-linked alpha-D-glucose residues. Amylo-alpha-1,6-glucosidase catalyzes the endohydrolysis of 1,6-alpha-D-glucoside linkages at points of branching in chains of 1,4-linked alpha-D-glucose residues. The catalytic triad (DED), which is highly conserved in other debranching enzymes, is not present in this group. The Alpha-amylase family comprises the largest family of glycoside hydrolases (GH), with the majority of enzymes acting on starch, glycogen, and related oligo- and polysaccharides. These proteins catalyze the transformation of alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glucosidic linkages with retention of the anomeric center. The protein is described as having 3 domains: A, B, C. A is a (beta/alpha) 8-barrel; B is a loop between the beta 3 strand and alpha 3 helix of A; C is the C-terminal extension characterized by a Greek key. The majority of the enzymes have an active site cleft found between domains A and B where a triad of catalytic residues (Asp, Glu and Asp) performs catalysis. Other members of this family have lost the catalytic activity as in the case of the human 4F2hc, or only have 2 residues that serve as the catalytic nucleophile and the acid/base, such as Thermus A4 beta-galactosidase with 2 Glu residues (GH42) and human alpha-galactosidase with 2 Asp residues (GH31). The family members are quite extensive and include: alpha amylase, maltosyltransferase, cyclodextrin glycotransferase, maltogenic amylase, neopullulanase, isoamylase, 1,4-alpha-D-glucan maltotetrahydrolase, 4-alpha-glucotransferase, oligo-1,6-glucosidase, amylosucrase, sucrose phosphorylase, and amylomaltase.</td></tr>

This family includes the following closely related glycosyl hydrolase family 31 (GH31) enzymes: maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM), sucrase-isomaltase (SI), lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), neutral alpha-glucosidase C (GANC), the alpha subunit of neutral alpha-glucosidase AB (GANAB), and alpha-glucosidase II. MGAM is one of the two enzymes responsible for catalyzing the last glucose-releasing step in starch digestion. SI is implicated in the digestion of dietary starch and major disaccharides such as sucrose and isomaltose, while GAA degrades glycogen in the lysosome, cleaving both alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glucosidic linkages. MGAM and SI are anchored to small-intestinal brush-border epithelial cells. The absence of SI from the brush border membrane or its malfunction is associated with malabsorption disorders such as congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID). The domain architectures of MGAM and SI include two tandem GH31 catalytic domains, an N-terminal domain found near the membrane-bound end and a C-terminal luminal domain. Both of the tandem GH31 domains of MGAM and SI are included in this family. The domain architecture of GAA includes an N-terminal TFF (trefoil factor family) domain in addition to the GH31 catalytic domain. Deficient GAA expression causes Pompe disease, an autosomal recessive genetic disorder also known as glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII). GANC and GANAB are key enzymes in glycogen metabolism that hydrolyze terminal, non-reducing 1,4-linked alpha-D-glucose residues from glycogen in the endoplasmic reticulum. Alpha-glucosidase II is a GH31 enzyme, found in bacteria and plants, which has exo-alpha-1,4-glucosidase and oligo-1,6-glucosidase activities. Alpha-glucosidase II has been characterized in Bacillus thermoamyloliquefaciens where it forms a homohexamer. This family also includes the MalA alpha-glucosidase from Sulfolobus solfataricus and the AglA alpha-glucosidase from Picrophilus torridus. MalA is part of the carbohydrate-metabolizing machinery that allows this organism to utilize carbohydrates, such as maltose, as the sole carbon and energy source. The MGAM-like family corresponds to subgroup 1 in the Ernst et al classification of GH31 enzymes.</td></tr>
