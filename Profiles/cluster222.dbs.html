Many C2 domains are Ca2+-dependent membrane-targeting modules that bind a wide variety of substances including bind phospholipids, inositol polyphosphates, and intracellular proteins.  Most C2 domain proteins are either signal transduction enzymes that contain a single C2 domain, such as protein kinase C, or membrane trafficking proteins which contain at least two C2 domains, such as synaptotagmin 1.  However, there are a few exceptions to this including RIM isoforms and some splice variants of piccolo/aczonin and intersectin which only have a single C2 domain.  C2 domains with a calcium binding region have negatively charged residues, primarily aspartates, that serve as ligands for calcium ions.

In eukaryotes, MMCE is an essential enzyme in a pathway that converts propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, and is important in the breakdown of odd-chain length fatty acids, branched-chain amino acids, and other metabolites.

They are ubiquitous enzymes involved in fundamental processes like photosynthesis, respiration, pH homeostasis and ion transport.

The polo-like Ser/Thr kinases (Plk1, Plk2/Snk, Plk3/Prk/Fnk, Plk4/Sak, and the inactive kinase Plk5) play various roles in cytokinesis and mitosis. At their C-terminus, they contain a tandemly repeated polo-box domain (in the case of Plk4, a tandem repeat of cryptic PBDs is found in the middle of the protein followed by a C-terminal single repeat), which appears to be involved in autoinhibition and in mediating the subcellular localization. The latter may be controlled via interactions between the polo-box domain and phospho-peptide motifs. The phosphopeptide binding site is formed at the interface between the two tandemly repeated PBDs. The PBDs of Plk4/Sak appear unique in participating in homodimer interactions, though it is not clear whether and how they interact with phosphopeptides.</td></tr>

PKs catalyze the transfer of the gamma-phosphoryl group from ATP to serine/threonine (ST) or tyrosine residues on protein substrates. Members of this group include MAPKKs from plants, kinetoplastids, alveolates, and mycetozoa. The MAPKK, LmxPK4, from Leishmania mexicana, is important in differentiation and virulence. Dictyostelium discoideum MEK1 is required for proper chemotaxis; MEK1 null mutants display severe defects in cell polarization and directional movement. Plants contain multiple MAPKKs like other eukaryotes. The Arabidopsis genome encodes for 10 MAPKKs while poplar and rice contain 13 MAPKKs each. The functions of these proteins have not been fully elucidated. There is evidence to suggest that MAPK cascades are involved in plant stress responses. In Arabidopsis, MKK3 plays a role in pathogen signaling; MKK2 is involved in cold and salt stress signaling; MKK4/MKK5 participates in innate immunity; and MKK7 regulates basal and systemic acquired resistance. The MAPKK subfamily is part of a larger superfamily that includes the catalytic domains of other STKs, protein tyrosine kinases, RIO kinases, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase, choline kinase, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.</td></tr>

Synaptotagmin is a membrane-trafficking protein characterized by a N-terminal transmembrane region, a linker, and 2 C-terminal C2 domains. Synaptotagmin 1, a member of class 1 synaptotagmins, is located in the brain and endocranium and localized to the synaptic vesicles and secretory granules.  It functions as a Ca2+ sensor for fast exocytosis as do synaptotagmins 5, 6, and 10. It is distinguished from the other synaptotagmins by having an N-glycosylated N-terminus. Synaptotagmins 5, 6, and 10, members of class 3 synaptotagmins, are located primarily in the brain and localized to the active zone and plasma membrane.  They is distinguished from the other synaptotagmins by having disulfide bonds at its N-terminus.  Synaptotagmin 6 also regulates the acrosome reaction, a unique Ca2+-regulated exocytosis, in sperm. Synaptotagmin 9, a class 5 synaptotagmins, is located in the brain and localized to the synaptic vesicles.  It is thought to be a Ca2+-sensor for dense-core vesicle exocytosis. Previously all synaptotagmins were thought to be calcium sensors in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and hormone secretion, but it has been shown that not all of them bind calcium.  Of the 17 identified synaptotagmins only 8 bind calcium (1-3, 5-7, 9, 10).  The function of the two C2 domains that bind calcium are: regulating the fusion step of synaptic vesicle exocytosis (C2A) and  binding to phosphatidyl-inositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) in the absence of calcium ions and to phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) in their presence (C2B).  C2B also regulates also the recycling step of synaptic vesicles.
